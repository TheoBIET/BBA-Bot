Yumeko is an open source bot created for Discord. Powered by NodeJS and MongoDB thanks to the Discord.js library.
Its purpose is to bring together the maximum functionality in a single script and avoid having around 15 bots in your server. 
You can freely retrieve the source code, modify it and host it on your own. Invitation -> https://bit.ly/3kFpS32



* You can also **participate** in its improvement by creating **new branches**, these will be examined and **imported if necessary**.
* **Very little** support will be provided, the code is not **complicated**, if you know **javascript** there shouldn't be any issues.
* A lot of **configurable** options and EXP system!
* Around 50 commands (**music, moderation, random image, miscellaneous,...**)!
