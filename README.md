Yumeko is an open source bot created for Discord. Powered by NodeJS and MongoDB thanks to the Discord.js library.
Its purpose is to bring together the maximum functionality in a single script and avoid having around 15 bots in your server. 
You can freely retrieve the source code, modify it and host it on your own.


* You can also **participate** in its improvement by creating **new branches**, these will be examined and **imported if necessary**.
* **Very little** support will be provided, the code is not **complicated**, if you know **javascript** there shouldn't be any issues.
* A lot of **configurable** options and EXP system!
* Around 50 commands (**music, moderation, random image, miscellaneous,...**)!

<p align="center">
Regularly, new commands and updates are added. If you have troubles, contact me via Discord. I will try to fix the problem as soon as possible.

I tried to be original in the 'design' of the bot with well-worked embeds, such as the statistics system which is really complete

Actually, i'm trying to improve the music system. You can use it now, but you may encounter some harmless problems
